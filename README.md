This project was created by following the project tutorial found in Python Crash Course 3rd Ed.
Assets were used from https://opengameart.org/.

Gameplay:

You are the pilot of a spaceship that is blue. There are a fleet of orange spaceships that are
enemies headed towards your way to destroy your home planet behind you. You are the last hope.

The enemy spaceships will come flying towards you and you must shoot them down. If they get to
you or past your defenses your ship will be blown up taking out the remainder of enemies in the 
round and a new clone with a new spaceship will take on the next waves of enemies.

Once you have used up all three of your 'lives' the game will end displaying the end screen.
To start a new game you may press the 'e' key to start a new game.

TODO:

Implement a scoring system.
Display the number of lives available to player.
Keep track of past highscores.
Display past highscores at end of game.
Increased difficulty with round progression.
Power ups that can spawn randomly.
